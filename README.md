## ✨ Dynamic Bubble Sort Visualization in C 🎨

This repository showcases an interactive and visually rich implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in C. It contains two files, dsaproject.c and dsaprog.c, both designed to visualize the sorting process in real time. Perfect for students, educators, and developers who want to see algorithms come to life!

## Key Features:

🔄 Real-Time Sorting Visualization:
Watch the Bubble Sort algorithm in action with visual feedback for each step. Elements being compared or swapped are highlighted 🔴 for clarity.

⏱️ Interactive Delay Mechanism:
Observe the sorting process step by step with a built-in delay feature.

🎲 Randomized Array Input:
Generates random integers to create diverse sorting scenarios, enhancing algorithm comprehension.

📜 Clean and Modular Code:
Both files are crafted for readability and educational value, making them ideal for learning data structures and algorithms.

## 🛠️ Usage:
Compile and run either dsaproject.c or dsaprog.c to observe the Bubble Sort process in action.
